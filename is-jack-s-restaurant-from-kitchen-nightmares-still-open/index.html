From venturebeat.com
When we originally wrote our kingston cafe kitchen nightmares update in 2017, the restaurant was still open and doing well. Gordon ramsay’s kitchen nightmares (usa) aired from 2007 to 2014 and kept the viewers glued to their tv screens with 7 seasons and 90 episodes. Clair shores, michigan, is a summer resort community about 40 minutes from detroit. The show “kitchen nightmares” debuted in the united states in the united kingdom in 2003, and it has since aired in over 10 countries.
